# **AIDAN VELDMAN NOTEBOOK**

## **9/12/2025 FRIDAY**

Today we met with the pitchers of our project and discussed a lot about what the design and ultimate goals of the projeect will entail. 
We were able to obtain the tube that the camera will travel down in the root system, which should help for our own visualization and further development of the design.

A major thing of note: I at the moment believe the focus of the project should be on the imaging portion of the camera, as the rest are achievable solutions that other root imaging cameras tackle,
but our current design would solve a lot of other issues. Also, if we can make a cheaper manufacturable variation of the camera it could be further developed for longer exposure in the accrylic tubes and maybe lessen manual interaction.

DESIGN NOTES: PCB will most likely have to be thin and vertical, on-board battery is most likely the less preffered method, since root images will want to be observed immediately after recording, so a usb interface to interect with a laptop is ideal.
              How the camera will be lowered will also be very important, as manual rappelling is significantly less complex but will have to be accounted for elsewhere, as the moment when images should be captured is tied to the location of the camera and speed it descends.
              We have discussed multiple ways to do this but ultimately there is not too much of a consensus yet. An encoder that tracks the location of the wheels may be preffered but implementation is questionable.
